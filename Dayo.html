	   <p>I am an enthusiastic, ambitious individual who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake or situation that I am presented with. With over six years of experience in Administrative management, I am eager to put the theoretical knowledge I have acquired over the past years into good use. Through the completion of work placements and work experience, I have also gained a great deal of practical experience. Within those years, and in aspects of my university education, I have shown myself to be a dedicate worker who makes it priority to maintain a good work ethic. I am a punctual, well-spoken individual who can communicate with various levels of personnel with ease. My adaptability and strong communication skills will make me a great fit for your team and ensure strong relationships are built with clients.

I am driven to succeed and with my vast aptitude for learning new skills and optimistic attitude, I am sure I will contribute to the growth of your organisation</p>
