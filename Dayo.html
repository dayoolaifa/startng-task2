	<h2><strong><u>Personal Profile</u></strong></h2>
	<p>I am an enthusiastic, ambitious individual who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake or situation that I am presented with. With over six years of experience in Administrative management, I am eager to put the theoretical knowledge I have acquired over the past years into good use. Through the completion of work placements and work experience, I have also gained a great deal of practical experience. Within those years, and in aspects of my university education, I have shown myself to be a dedicate worker who makes it priority to maintain a good work ethic. I am a punctual, well-spoken individual who can communicate with various levels of personnel with ease. My adaptability and strong communication skills will make me a great fit for your team and ensure strong relationships are built with clients. I recently led a team for the development and implementation of INGO Web Portal Forum for Mercy Corps. I was part of a team that conducted a research on market analysis to aid the reintegration of children associated with Boko Haram and th Civilian Joint Task Force sponsored by UNICEF in partnership with Search For Common Ground (SFCG), Nigeria to prevent further enrolment in radical camps. I am driven to succeed and with my vast aptitude for learning new skills and optimistic attitude, I am sure I will contribute to the growth of your organisation</p>
